**MIL Version** MIL X SP6

**Type** Example

**Description**  
This program shows how to perform IP Multicast with GigE Vision devices. To do this you must have a network capable of delivering a Multicast service over IPv4. This requires the use of routers and LAN switches that support the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). Some manual configuration of you LAN switches might be required. More information can be found in the IP Multicast section of Matrox GigE Vision Assistant's help file.

The project structure, including the xml, aims to be copied in "\Users\Public\Documents\Matrox Imaging\MIL\Examples\BoardSpecific\MulticastSlave" of the MIL installation directory to be displayed by the MIL example launcher.
